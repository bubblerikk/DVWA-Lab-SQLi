# DVWA-Lab-SQLi
To identify the potential threats in any application with Sqli briefed understanding and steps explained with kali as "Attacker" and target as DVWA "Vulnerable website"

## Overview
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities using the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) as a target and Kali Linux as the attack platform. It is designed to help users identify, exploit, and understand potential threats associated with SQLi in web applications, while also emphasizing mitigation strategies.

## Objectives
- Understand SQL Injection: Grasp the fundamentals of SQL injection vulnerabilities, their causes, and real-world implications.
- Hands-On Attacks: Follow step-by-step methodologies to perform SQLi attacks using Kali Linux on the DVWA environment.
- Threat Identification: Recognize various types of SQLi attacks and the risks they pose to applications.
- Mitigation Techniques: Learn best practices and defensive mechanisms to secure applications from SQLi threats.

## Table of Contents
- Prerequisites (prerequisites)
- Lab Setup (lab-setup)
- SQL Injection Concepts (sql-injection-concepts)
- Attack Scenarios (attack-scenarios)
- Threat Analysis (threat-analysis)
- Prevention & Mitigation (prevention -mitigation)

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of web applications, databases, and security concepts.
- Installed copies of:
  - Kali Linux (as the attacker environment)
  - DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application, as the target)
- Web browser with internet access.
- Administrative rights on your local machine or VM.

## Lab Setup
1. Installing DVWA:  
   - Download and set up DVWA on a local or virtual server/or use 'Metasploitable-2' machine >> https://download.vulnhub.com/metasploitable/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip
   - Download the machine from above link 
   - extract it 
   - We require 'Virtual Box' like > "VMware Workstation Pro".
		follow the instruction in this video > link- https://youtu.be/m_sSN61S43Y?si=TLv_UoGPqIJCoQLb
   - then, open it in 'Metasploitable-2' extracted file with >> 'open a virtual machine' option
   - Configure the database and web server as required.

2. Configuring Kali Linux:  
   - Set up Kali Linux with essential penetration testing tools.
   - Ensure both DVWA and Kali are on the same network for ease of testing.
	check the following 
	go to >> Player (left upper corner) >> Manage >> Virtual Machine Settings >> Network Adapter >> make sure both machines are in "NAT".

## SQL Injection Concepts
- What is SQL Injection?  
  Injection flaw that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database.

- Types of SQLi Attacks:
  - *In-band SQLi*: Direct response via application (e.g., error-based, union-based)
  - *Inferential (Blind) SQLi*: No direct response, attacker deduces information through application behavior
  - *Out-of-band SQLi*: Attacker receives data via a different channel

- Potential Impacts:
  - Unauthorized data access
  - Data manipulation or deletion
  - Gaining administrative access
  - Full system compromise

## Attack Scenarios
- Basic SQL Injection  
  Exploiting simple input fields to execute unauthorized SQL commands.

- Union-Based Attacks  
  Using the UNION SQL operator to retrieve data from other tables.

- Error-Based SQLi  
  Triggering and analyzing database errors to extract information.

- Blind SQL Injection  
  Extracting data by observing true/false responses or time delays.

- Automated Attacks (using tools like sqlmap)  
  Automating injection and extraction processes for efficiency.

Steps Explained:
- Identifying injectable fields
- Crafting SQL payloads
- Extracting data manually and via tools
- Bypassing authentication
- Escalating privileges

## Impact:
- Attack Vectors:
  - User input fields (login forms, search bars, URL parameters)
  - Cookies and HTTP headers

- Potential Threats:
  - Data breaches
  - Loss of data integrity
  - Unauthorized access to database and system files
  - Service disruptions

- Real-world Examples:
  - Highlight notable data breaches caused by SQLi in the recent past.

## Prevention & Mitigation
- Sanitization & Validation  
  Always validate and sanitize user inputs.

- Use of Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries  
  Prevent execution of untrusted input as part of SQL commands.

- Least Privilege Principle  
  Grant the minimal required permissions to the database users.

- Regular Security Audits  
  Regularly scan and test applications for SQLi vulnerabilities.

- Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)  
  Deploy WAFs to filter malicious traffic and identify suspicious patterns.
